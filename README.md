# config-files
I used blackarch's i3 configs as a template and a part of .bashrc to get the above files. Uploading here just incase if I need this in future. You can use it for yourself if you find it interesting.

I used [xss-lock](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=xss-lock) for locking the system with i3 lock when it suspends, sleeps etc. It subscribes to the systemd-events suspend, hibernate, lock-session, and unlock-session with appropriate actions.

Moved to sway+waybar from i3.
