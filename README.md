# i3-config-files
Modified config files from blackarch

I used [xss-lock](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=xss-lock)for locking the system with i3 lock when it suspends, sleeps etc. It subscribes to the systemd-events suspend, hibernate, lock-session, and unlock-session with appropriate actions.
